// ToDo: 
// Pass addContact state variable to the ContactList through Router props (or through props passed through Link? ). Here is how data should flow through app: AddContact sends data through props to ContactList, where contacts get rendered; In ContactList, by clicking on each contact, data from that contact gets passed through (again router or Link props??) to individual contact view where it gets rendered.
